# RAT-Benchmark
This repository contains Matlab implementations of the algorithms used in our paper entitled "Evaluating Performance of RAT Selection Algorithms for 5G HetNets", which we are submitting to be considered for publication in the IEEE Access journal. Our benchmark includes a library of different radio access technology (RAT) selection algorithms including:
- HSS (Highest Signal Strength): the default RAT association mechanism
- LSH (Local Search Heuristic): a centralized approach with local search 
- RM (Regret Matching): a partially distributed game-theoretic algorithm
- RSG (RAT Selection Games): a non-cooperative game-theoretic algorithm
- ERL (Enhanced Reinforcement Learning): a RL algorithm with network-assisted feedback
- CODIPAS (Combined Fully Distributed Payoff and Strategy): a fully distributed RL algoirthm

# Dataset
The following datasets are used in setting up PHY data rates of mobile users based on the mapping table of the corresponding technology.
- The WiFi dataset: this dataset provides traces of Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurement of the WiFi base stations collected at the University of Colorado. Available to access at https://crawdad.org/~crawdad/cu/cu_wart/20111024/.
- The LTE dataset: this dataset provides the measured Channel Quality Indication (CQI) of a real-word LTE base stations from a tier-1 LTE operator in North America.
